<h1>IB Computer Science: IA Project</h1>

<p>For my IB Computer Science final I developed a login system for volunteers at a local charity.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>The charity I consulted for has the problem of recording volunteers information. Furthermore, they are not able to track how many times a volunteer has volunteered each month, yaer, or time period. </p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>I developed a login system for volunteers at a charity using the MERN stack. When a volunteer visits the charity, they will go to the website and either sign-in to their account or create own. Each time the user signs in, a tally increments to reflect their participation to the charity. Finally, the charity could access all the users via an admin page.</p>

<h2>Improvements/Future Recommendations</h2>
<p>If I had more time to work on the project I would have focused for the the security of the website. For authentication I used json webtokens, yet when I fetched them all the users data would show as well (not feasible for security purposes). Aside from security, I would improve the search/sort algorithm for volunteer accounts.</p>
